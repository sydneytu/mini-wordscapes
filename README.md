# mini-wordscapes

###Rules of the Game
Inspired by the popular moble app game Wordscapes, I decided to create my own mini version as a way to brush up on my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. This is a simple anagram word game in which a random scrambled word will br given to you and you have a limited amount of time to find all of the target words within that word. Guesses must be at least 4 letters long.

Ex. The chosen word is "". Possible words you can create are "", and so on.

You are able to click on the times to create words or type using the keyboard. 

Have fun!
